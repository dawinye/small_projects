First, create some labels that will act as statuses for how far you are in the recruitment cycle at a company. I did "Applied", "OAs/Interviewing", "Rejected", "Offers".

As you apply to companies and interview, drag the emails that you get from companies into the corresponding labels. 
Then, create a new Google Spreadsheet and name the sheet something like "New Grad"
Go to Extensions -> AppScript. Copy paste the code in this github repo into the code editor. You will need to change the first few lines based on the labels and the spreadsheet id you used. 
When you click run, it'll say you don't have permission, just click advanaced options or something and click go ahead.
Finally, Insert -> Drawing. Make a drawing of a button to refresh your spreadsheet. Assign it the same name as the .gs file that the code is in.
